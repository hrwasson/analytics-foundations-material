# 1. Revisit the NormTemp dataset from Lab 1, where we examined the observed mean body temperature (temperature) in comparison to the well-known “average” of 98.6.

# Perform a statistical test (alpha = 0.05) to determine whether this well- known number is actually the mean body temperature. What is your p-value? Explain in words what this p-value means. What is your conclusion?

```{r}
library(UsingR)
data(normtemp)

t.test(normtemp$temperature, mu = 98.6)
